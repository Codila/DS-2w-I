# HIV Drug Resistance Predictions

Reason for Study:
Anti-retroviral therapy (ART) has successfully helped managing HIV/AIDS, but lead to emergence of HIVDR mutations.

First aim of this project is to collect the data of Failing of Anti-retroviral therapy (ART)among Indian people living with HIV (PLHIV) Later we will try to find the probability of emergence of HIVDR in India categorised by region based on predictive model using ML algorithm.
Some Questions?
  Classification problem -- To predict if the ART therapy based on some features will be successfull or not on given 1st stage patrients
    features- 1)Patients in depression 2) forgettng to take pills 3) drugs which are already not working (protease inhibitors) 4)suboptimal dose before born in children 5) whiat extent the patient have been exposed to the ART drugs 6) how many are being treated on second line drugs and how many on 1st line drugs 7) Multi-drug resistance in treatment-experienced human immune deficiency virus (HIV) patients has been a major cause to first line antiretroviral therapy (ART) failure necessitating a switch to second line therapy
    Features:Demographic details, symptoms, adverse drug reactions (ADRs), second line ART regimens, CD4 count, and plasma viral load (PVL) 
    Find patients taking ART includes clinical and/or immunological and/or virologic failure in a patient who had received 6 months or more of standard first-line ART
    The patients qualify for second line ART if they demonstrate CD4 decline to pre-ART values, CD4 drop to less than 50% of peak on-treatment value, failure to achieve CD4 greater than 100 c/mm3 (immunologic failure), or develop a new WHO stage III/IV AIDS-defining illness (clinical failure), or those with HIV RNA 10,000 c/ml or greater (virological failure).[7]\
  More factors for making the prediction body weight, WHO stage, opportunistic infections
  Regression problem- Given the rate of ART failure what percent/capita will be the victim of Drug resitance by the year 2030
  
  One question to answer  by model could be which treatment failure can be dropped from the current availble treatments w/o affecting the drug resistance or ART theray effectiveness hence which can save lots of cost and that cost can be put to utilized for better second line treatments...
